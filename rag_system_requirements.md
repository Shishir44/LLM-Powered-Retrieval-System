# RAG System Requirement Document

## Objective
This document outlines the requirements for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to retrieve and generate contextually relevant answers using a knowledge base composed of structured technology-related documents.

## Document Base
The system will ingest and index a set of documents categorized under the **Technology** domain. Each document includes:
- **Title**
- **Content**
- **Category** (e.g., Technology)
- **Subcategory** (e.g., AI, DevOps, Blockchain)
- **Tags** (comma-separated)
- **Metadata** (optional key-value pairs)

### Example Topics in the Document Base:
- Docker and containerization
- CI/CD pipelines
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda)
- Zero trust security models
- Web3 and decentralization
- Data warehousing and analytics
- Green computing
- Programming languages
- Quantum computing
- APIs and system integration
- AI bias and ethical design
- Game design using AI

## RAG System Functional Requirements

### üîç Document Ingestion
- The system must accept documents in JSON format and store them in a vectorized form using embeddings.
- Each document should be chunked logically (by section, paragraph, or semantic block).

### üß† Retrieval
- Query embeddings must be compared against document embeddings using a similarity search algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity).
- Top-k most relevant chunks must be retrieved for generation.

### üí¨ Generation
- Use a language model (e.g., GPT, Gemini, Mistral) to answer user queries using retrieved context.
- Ensure responses stay grounded in retrieved documents.
- Return citation or source document if available.

## Evaluation Methodology

### ‚úÖ Simple Fact-Based Queries
These queries should return exact or near-exact answers from a single document:
- What is Docker?
- Define zero trust security.
- What is the purpose of an API?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Moderate Contextual Queries
The system should handle rephrased and paraphrased questions:
- How does Docker help in CI/CD pipelines?
- Why is green computing important?
- What are neural networks used for?

### üîÅ Multi-Hop or Comparative Queries
The system should synthesize answers across multiple documents:
- Compare traditional APIs with Web3 smart contracts.
- How does zero trust differ from VPNs?

### üß† Complex Reasoning Queries
These questions require combining retrieval with reasoning:
- How would an e-commerce platform benefit from CI/CD and Docker?
- Design a system using serverless, 5G, and AI for agriculture monitoring.

---

## Success Criteria

The RAG system should:
- Correctly retrieve relevant document chunks.
- Provide concise, accurate, and contextual answers.
- Handle paraphrased, comparative, and reasoning queries.
- Return traceable sources (optional).

## Integration Use Case

The final RAG module will be integrated into an **AI Code Editor** to:
- Offer code explanations
- Recommend tools or services (e.g., Docker, AWS)
- Clarify architectural decisions
- Help developers understand core technical concepts

## Appendix: Sample Test Queries

1. What is Docker?
2. What does 5G enable in IoT devices?
3. Define zero trust security.
4. Why is green computing important?
5. Compare traditional APIs with Web3.
6. Design a system using serverless, 5G, and AI for agriculture.

**Note:** Adding these 15+ documents as described should enable the RAG to confidently answer all above queries with accuracy and relevance.
